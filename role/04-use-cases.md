# AI Use Cases Analysis

Based on 4,525 extracted use cases from 895 job descriptions.

Methodology note: I collected all use cases into a single file and used AI (Claude) to analyze and categorize them. This is not a quantitative analysis like the [skills analysis](02-skills.md) (see the [analysis notebook](../job-market/analysis.ipynb) for that) - it's based on the questions I asked and the patterns Claude identified in the data. It may be less precise, but I believe it's still representative of what's happening in the market.

## Summary

The use cases reveal what companies are actually building with AI today. This is the real-world application landscape that AI Engineers work on daily.

Total use cases extracted: 4,525

- AI-First roles: 3,177 use cases (70.2%)

## Key Insights

### 1. Automation is the Primary Use Case

The most common problem AI solves is automating manual workflows. This is not glamorous - it's about reducing repetitive work, coordinating processes, and handling scale.

### 2. Knowledge Access is Universal

Every domain has the same problem: too much information, cannot find what's needed. RAG and semantic search solve this across healthcare (medical literature), finance (regulations), legal (contracts), and general enterprise (internal docs).

### 3. Customer Support is a Major Driver

Customer-facing solutions are a top category because they directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction. The ROI is clear: reduce support costs while improving response times.

### 4. Production is Hard

A significant portion of use cases focus on deployment infrastructure. This reflects the real challenge of getting AI models from notebooks to production reliably.

### 5. Domain Specialization Matters

While fewer in number, fine-tuned models for specific domains (insurance, legal, cybersecurity) represent high-value applications where generic models are insufficient.
