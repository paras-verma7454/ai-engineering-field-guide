# AI Engineering Responsibilities Analysis

Based on 5,694 responsibilities extracted from 895 job descriptions.

Methodology note: I collected all responsibilities into a single file and used AI (Claude) to analyze and categorize them. This is not a quantitative analysis like the [skills analysis](02-skills.md) (see the [analysis notebook](../job-market/analysis.ipynb) for that) - it's based on the questions I asked and the patterns Claude identified in the data. It may be less precise, but I believe it's still representative of what's happening in the market.

## Key Insights

### 1. Building is the Primary Responsibility

Building systems is the core responsibility. AI Engineers are builders first and foremost.

### 2. Production is a Major Responsibility

When you combine deployment, monitoring, and maintenance, productionizing AI is a major portion of the work - much larger than initially apparent.

### 3. Quality is Not Optional

Evaluation and quality assurance are core responsibilities. AI Engineers are expected to build systems that work reliably and safely.

### 4. Provider APIs Dominate

Most AI Engineers use provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) rather than self-hosting. Self-hosting is only needed for privacy, cost at scale, or latency requirements.

### 5. RAG is Common

RAG and retrieval are standard responsibilities - not niche. Most AI Engineers work on systems that connect LLMs to their proprietary data.

### 6. Fine-tuning is Uncommon

Despite the hype, fine-tuning is not a day-to-day responsibility for most AI Engineers. Most roles use existing models with RAG and prompting.
